# Langflow Architect Documentation Organization

## Documentation Structure

All documentation for the **Langflow Architect** application is organized within the `langflow-architect/` directory to maintain clear separation from the main Langflow platform documentation.

### Directory Structure

## Key Documentation Files

### Primary Architecture
  - Complete technical architecture for web search and MCP integration
  - Brownfield enhancement approach maintaining existing CopilotKit foundation
  - Component specifications, API design, testing strategy, security integration
  - See: `architecture/` (above)

### Product Requirements
- See: `prd/`

### Implementation Guidance
- See: `plans/` and `plans/phases/`

### Analysis and Technical Specs
- See: `analysis/`

### Status and Method
- See: `status/` and `method/`

### User Stories and Epics
- See: `stories/`

## Documentation Principles
- **Main Langflow platform docs** remain in the root `docs/` directory
- Clear boundaries prevent documentation mixing and confusion
- All implementation follows the architecture specifications
- Epic stories derive from architectural component definitions
- Change logs are maintained within individual documents
- Epic consolidation guide provides migration paths for evolving requirements
- **Architecture**: Complete brownfield enhancement architecture
- **Epic Structure**: 5 epics with consolidation strategy
- **Epic 5**: Enhanced Agent Intelligence (primary development target)
- **Brownfield Architecture**: Implementation following architectural specifications
- **MCP Integration**: User-configurable MCP server setup
- **Web Search**: Tavily + DuckDuckGo integration with attribution

### ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Begin Epic 5 Phase 1 implementation (Context Understanding + MCP Management)
2. Enhance existing CopilotKit integration with external knowledge sources
3. Create domain-specific test scenarios for healthcare M365 use cases
4. Establish MCP server development environment and configurations

## Document Ownership and Maintenance

### Primary Documents (High Maintenance)
- `brownfield-enhancement-architecture.md` - Architecture team
- `stories/epic-5-enhanced-agent-intelligence.md` - Product team + Development team
- `epic-consolidation-guide.md` - Product team

### Reference Documents (Low Maintenance)
- Historical PRD and specification documents
- Original standalone architecture and implementation plans
- Foundation epics (1-4) maintained for reference during migration

This organization ensures all Langflow Architect documentation remains centralized, well-organized, and clearly separated from the main Langflow platform documentation.
