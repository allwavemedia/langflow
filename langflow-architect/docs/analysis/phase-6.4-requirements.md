# Phase 6.4 Requirements — Domain Expertise & Compliance Intelligence

## 1) Goals

- Accurate domain detection and persistent activation
- Real-time compliance guidance and validation across 5+ frameworks
- Adaptive Socratic questioning by domain and user expertise
- Maintain zero ESLint warnings and strict TypeScript

## 2) Actors and Personas

- Non-technical workflow creators
- Compliance officers/approvers
- Developers maintaining system

## 3) Functional Requirements

- Detect domain signals from conversation context
- Activate domain-specific knowledge profiles
- Provide compliance alerts and recommendations in real time
- Generate domain-tailored questions and prompts
- Persist domain context across sessions

## 4) Non-Functional Requirements

- P95 response time to first token < 2s
- Availability 99.9% (platform-dependent)
- Zero ESLint warnings; type safe
- Observability for detections and compliance checks

## 5) Constraints and Assumptions

- Next.js + CopilotKit stack
- Optional external services for compliance knowledge
- Hybrid detection: heuristics-first, embeddings-ready

## 6) Acceptance Criteria

- ≥90% domain detection accuracy on eval set; ≤5% FP
- Compliance checks enabled for HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, FDA
- >85% UX satisfaction in testing for adaptive questioning
- Zero ESLint warnings at release

## 7) Risks

- Regulatory ambiguity; schema drift; overfitting to keywords

## 8) Out of Scope

- Full multi-tenant RBAC; vendor-specific onboarding beyond first integration

## 9) Design Readiness Confirmation

- Scope freeze for Phase 6.4: Domain detection, compliance guidance (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, FDA), adaptive Socratic questioning, persistence, and observability.
- Success thresholds: As stated in Acceptance Criteria section; deviations require change request.
- Dependencies acknowledged: Next.js + CopilotKit, optional external knowledge sources; hybrid detection.
- Gates to proceed: Research Worksheet filled (DONE), Risks documented (DONE), KPIs defined (DONE).
- Status: APPROVED to proceed to Design.
