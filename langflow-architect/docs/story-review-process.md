# Ongoing Story Review Process

This document outlines the process for the ongoing review of user stories to ensure they consistently meet the quality standards defined in the [Story Quality Validation Checklist](./story-quality-validation-checklist.md).

## Process Steps

1.  **Story Creation**: The Product Manager or a designated author creates a new user story.

2.  **Initial Self-Review**: The author performs a self-review using the [Story Quality Validation Checklist](./story-quality-validation-checklist.md) to ensure all criteria are met.

3.  **Peer Review**:
    *   The story is submitted for peer review to at least one other team member (e.g., a developer, QA engineer, or another product manager).
    *   The reviewer assesses the story against the checklist and provides feedback or suggestions for improvement.
    *   This review should be completed within two business days.

4.  **Feedback Integration**: The author incorporates the feedback from the peer review, making any necessary revisions.

5.  **Final Approval**:
    *   Once revised, the story is submitted for final approval to the Product Manager (if not the author) and the technical lead.
    *   The approvers give a final check against the validation checklist.

6.  **Ready for Development**: After final approval, the story is marked as "Ready for Development" and can be scheduled into a sprint.

## Tooling

-   **Source Control**: User stories are managed as markdown files in the project's Git repository.
-   **Pull Requests**: Story reviews are conducted through pull requests, allowing for comments and discussion.
-   **Project Management**: The status of the story (e.g., "In Review," "Ready for Development") is tracked in the team's project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello).

## Responsibilities

-   **Author**: Responsible for creating the story and ensuring it meets quality standards.
-   **Reviewer**: Responsible for providing timely and constructive feedback.
-   **Product Manager**: Overall responsibility for the quality of the story backlog.
-   **Technical Lead**: Ensures technical feasibility and clarity of the requirements.
