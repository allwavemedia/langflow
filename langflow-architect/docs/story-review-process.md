# Story Review Process

## Overview

This document defines the standardized process for reviewing stories throughout their lifecycle, ensuring consistent quality and alignment with project objectives in the Langflow Architect project.

## Review Framework

### Review Types

#### 1. Initial Story Review (Pre-Implementation)
- **Trigger**: Story submitted for development
- **Reviewer**: Product Manager + Technical Lead
- **Duration**: 1-2 business days
- **Purpose**: Validate readiness for development

#### 2. Mid-Development Review (Optional)
- **Trigger**: Developer request or significant scope questions
- **Reviewer**: Technical Lead + Domain Expert
- **Duration**: Same day response
- **Purpose**: Address implementation questions and scope clarification

#### 3. Completion Review (Pre-Merge)
- **Trigger**: Story implementation complete, ready for merge
- **Reviewer**: QA Lead + Product Manager
- **Duration**: 2-3 business days
- **Purpose**: Validate acceptance criteria and quality standards

#### 4. Post-Implementation Review (Retrospective)
- **Trigger**: 1 week after story deployment
- **Reviewer**: Full team retrospective
- **Duration**: 30-minute team meeting
- **Purpose**: Identify process improvements and lessons learned

## Review Process Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Story Submission

#### Step 1: Automated Validation
```yaml
# Automated checks performed on story submission
automated_checks:
  - story_format_validation
  - acceptance_criteria_completeness
  - required_sections_present
  - link_accessibility_check
  - spelling_and_grammar_check
```

**Automated Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] Story follows standard template format
- [ ] All required sections are present and non-empty
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are numbered and specific
- [ ] All external links are accessible
- [ ] No obvious spelling or grammatical errors

#### Step 2: Manual Review Assignment
