# Architecture Document - Moved

**This document has been relocated to maintain BMad documentation structure.**

**New Location**: [`docs/architecture/architecture.md`](./architecture/architecture.md)

## Quick Access

For the complete technical architecture document, see:
- **Architecture Overview**: [`docs/architecture/`](./architecture/)
- **Standalone Architecture**: [`docs/architecture/variants/standalone.md`](./architecture/variants/standalone.md)
- **Enhancement Architecture**: [`docs/architecture/enhancement-architecture.md`](./architecture/enhancement-architecture.md)

This redirect ensures existing links continue to work during the documentation reorganization.
3. Component Breakdown3.1. Controller / OrchestratorResponsibility: This is the central brain of the agent. It receives user input, determines the current stage of the workflow (e.g., framing, inquiry, research, generation), and invokes the appropriate modules. It is responsible for routing information between modules and managing the overall conversational flow.Technology: Python-based application logic.3.2. State ManagerResponsibility: Maintains the state of the conversation. This includes the user's goal, gathered requirements, research findings, decision history, and the current state of the Langflow graph being constructed.Technology: A simple in-memory JSON object or dictionary for short-term interactions, potentially backed by a Redis cache or a simple database for longer, stateful conversations.3.3. Socratic EngineResponsibility: The core of the agent's persona. This module takes the current conversation state and generates the next Socratic question. It is responsible for identifying ambiguities in the user's request and formulating questions that guide the user toward clarity.Technology: This will be a prompt-driven LLM call. The prompt will be engineered to take the conversation history and current state as input and produce a clarifying, non-leading question.3.4. Research ModuleResponsibility: Executes autonomous research based on the conversation. It formulates queries, interacts with the external tool APIs (Web Browsing, MCP), and synthesizes the results into a concise summary of options and trade-offs.Technology: Python functions that act as clients for the specified tool APIs. It will handle API authentication, request formatting, and response parsing.3.5. Artifact Generation ModuleResponsibility: This module has two key functions:JSON Generation: Constructs the final, valid Langflow JSON file from the fully specified requirements stored in the State Manager.Guide Generation: Generates the beginner-friendly, step-by-step user guide. This will likely be another prompt-driven LLM call, providing the generated JSON and the user's original goal as context.Technology: Python logic for JSON construction and validation. An LLM call for the user guide generation.4. Data Flow & State ManagementUser Input: The user's message is received by the Controller.State Update: The Controller passes the input to the State Manager, which updates the conversation history.Module Invocation: The Controller, aware of the current workflow stage, invokes a primary module (e.g., the Socratic Engine).Contextual Execution: The invoked module receives the current state from the State Manager.Tool Interaction (if needed): If the Research Module is called, it interacts with external tools.Response Generation: The active module returns its output (e.g., a question, research summary) to the Controller.State Update: The Controller updates the State Manager with the new information.User Output: The Controller formats the response and sends it back to the user.Final Generation: This loop continues until the state is deemed "complete." The Controller then invokes the Artifact Generation Module to produce the final JSON and guide.5. Tool Integration StrategyAll external tools will be accessed via a dedicated Research Module. This creates a clean abstraction layer.Each tool (Web Browser, MCP Toolkit) will have its own API client within the module.Credentials and API keys will be managed via secure environment variables, never hardcoded.The module will include robust error handling for API failures, timeouts, or unexpected responses.6. Error Handling & SecurityInvalid User Input: The Socratic Engine should be designed to handle ambiguous or off-topic user input gracefully by asking questions to re-center the conversation.Tool Failure: The Research Module must have fallbacks. If a tool fails, it should report the failure to the Controller, which can then inform the user and suggest an alternative path.JSON Validation: The Artifact Generation Module MUST validate the generated JSON against the Langflow schema before presenting it to the user. If validation fails, it should attempt to self-correct or flag the issue.Security: As the agent may suggest custom Python code, it must include a clear disclaimer to the user about the risks of running untrusted code.
