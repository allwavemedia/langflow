- **[Epic Shards](./prd/)** - Individual epic files:
  - `epic-1-developer-experience.md` - Developer experience and foundation
  - `epic-2-tests-ci.md` - Testing and CI infrastructure 
  - `epic-3-deployment-ops.md` - Deployment and operations
  - `epic-4-socratic-json.md` - Socratic questioning and JSON generation
  - `epic-5-autonomy-research.md` - Autonomy and research capabilities

### Architecture

- **[Architecture Index](./architecture/architecture-index.md)** - Architecture documentation overview
- **[Application Architecture](./architecture/langflow-architect-architecture.md)** - Main application architecture

- **System Components**: coding standards, tech stack, source tree organization

### Stories

- **[Story Files](./stories/)** - Detailed story implementations:
  - `epic-1-standalone-foundation.md` - Epic 1 comprehensive implementation story
  - `epic-2-enhanced-socratic.md` - Epic 2 enhanced socratic questioning story
  - `epic-3-json-generation.md` - Epic 3 JSON generation capabilities story
  - `epic-4-deployment-ux.md` - Epic 4 deployment and UX enhancements story
  - `epic-5-enhanced-agent-intelligence.md` - Epic 5 agent intelligence story

### Supporting Documentation

#### Analysis & Research

- **[Analysis Index](./analysis/analysis-index.md)** - Analysis artifacts overview
- Domain & requirements analysis, technical specifications

#### Implementation Plans  

- **[Plans Index](./plans/plans-index.md)** - Implementation planning overview
- Phase-specific plans, roadmaps, execution strategies

#### Quality Assurance

- **[QA Index](./qa/qa-index.md)** - Quality assurance artifacts overview  
- Test reports, validation results, quality gate assessments

#### Project Status

- **[Status Index](./status/status-index.md)** - Project status tracking overview
- Current implementation state, progress tracking, milestone reports

## BMAD v4 Compliance Features

### Proper Sharding

- ✅ PRD sharded by application (langflow-architect.md)
- ✅ Epic shards for each major capability area
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns between documents
- ✅ Consistent cross-referencing and traceability

### Traceability Matrix

```
PRD → Epics → Stories → Architecture → Implementation Plans → QA Reports
  ↓       ↓        ↓          ↓               ↓              ↓
Goals → Features → Tasks → Components → Code Changes → Test Results
```

### Documentation Standards

- **Consistent Structure**: All documents follow BMAD v4 templates
- **Clear Ownership**: Each epic and story has defined ownership
- **Status Tracking**: Current implementation state clearly documented
- **Cross-References**: Proper linking between related documents
- **Version Control**: Change logs and status metadata maintained

## Navigation Guide

### For Product Managers
- Start with [PRD Index](./prd/prd.md) for requirements overview
- Review [Epic Shards](./prd/) for feature planning
- Check [Status Index](./status/status-index.md) for current progress

### For Architects  
- Review [Architecture Index](./architecture/architecture-index.md) for system design
- Examine [Implementation Plans](./plans/plans-index.md) for technical approach
- Consult [Analysis Index](./analysis/analysis-index.md) for technical research

### For Developers
- Start with [Stories](./stories/) for implementation details
- Reference [Architecture](./architecture/) for technical specifications
- Use [Implementation Plans](./plans/) for development guidance

### For QA Engineers
- Review [QA Index](./qa/qa-index.md) for testing strategies
- Check [Epic Shards](./prd/) for acceptance criteria
- Validate against [Architecture](./architecture/) specifications

## Document Maintenance

### Update Procedures
1. **PRD Changes**: Update main PRD and relevant epic shards
2. **Architecture Changes**: Update architecture documents and implementation plans
3. **Status Changes**: Update status documents and cross-references
4. **New Features**: Create new epic shards and story files as needed

### Quality Assurance
- All documents must maintain BMAD v4 compliance
- Cross-references must be validated and updated
- Status information must reflect actual implementation state
- New documents must follow established templates and patterns
