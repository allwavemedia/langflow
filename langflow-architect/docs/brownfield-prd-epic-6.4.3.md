### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable adaptive Socratic questioning that adjusts to user domain expertise and project context
- Provide progressively sophisticated guidance without overwhelming users with irrelevant details
- Integrate seamlessly with existing 92% accurate domain detection system (Epic 6.4.1)
- Maintain <3s response time performance while adding questioning sophistication
- Achieve >85% user satisfaction across any discovered domain without hardcoded patterns

#### Background Context

The Langflow Architect successfully implemented Dynamic Domain Intelligence in Epic 6.4.1, achieving 92% accuracy in domain detection with multi-source knowledge aggregation. However, the current questioning capabilities are limited to basic CopilotKit actions that don't adapt to user expertise or provide progressive disclosure.

Epic 6.4.3 addresses this gap by building an adaptive Socratic questioning system on top of the proven domain detection foundation. The enhancement leverages existing domain knowledge synthesis and multi-source intelligence to generate contextually relevant questions that guide users toward optimal workflow patterns. This brownfield approach ensures zero disruption to the operational domain detection system while adding sophisticated questioning intelligence.

## Requirements

*Based on comprehensive brownfield architecture analysis and existing system validation - these requirements align with documented project patterns and constraints.*

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The adaptive questioning system shall integrate with existing `domainDetectionSystem.ts` without modifying its 92% accuracy domain detection logic
