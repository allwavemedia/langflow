## üöÄ Key Features of the Implementation

### Minimal Changes Approach
The implementation focused entirely on documentation enhancement rather than code changes, following the principle of minimal modifications while providing maximum value.

### Development-Ready Specifications
Epic 6.4 now includes:
- Specific file paths following existing patterns (`src/components/`, `src/services/`, etc.)
- Environment configuration details with specific variables and configuration files
- Comprehensive testing scenarios (unit, integration, E2E) with specific test file locations
- Performance requirements with measurable targets
- AI integration patterns for GPT-4 function calling and context management

### Clear Migration Guidance
Epic 2 now provides:
- Prominent superseded warnings to prevent confusion
- Specific mapping to Epic 5 equivalents for each story
