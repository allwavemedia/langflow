# Dev Agent Implementation Handoff: Epic 6.4.3 Advanced Socratic Questioning

## Mission Statement

You are now the **Copilot Co-Developer Agent** tasked with implementing **Epic 6.4.3: Advanced Socratic Questioning** for the Langflow Architect project. This is a comprehensive brownfield enhancement that adds sophisticated adaptive questioning capabilities to an existing 70% complete Next.js/React/TypeScript project with 92% accurate domain detection.

## Project Context

**Current System**: Langflow Architect - Next.js 15.5.0, React 19.1.0, TypeScript 5, CopilotKit 1.10.2
- **Existing Foundation**: Epic 6.4.1 COMPLETE - Dynamic Domain Intelligence (92% accuracy, <3s response)
- **Current Location**: `a:\langflow\langflow-architect\`
- **Architecture**: Composition-based brownfield enhancement preserving 100% existing functionality

## Implementation Approach: SYSTEMATIC 5-STORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL**: Implement stories in exact sequence. Each story is a foundation for the next.

**Purpose**: Dynamic question generation with domain adaptation
**Depends**: Story 1.1 COMPLETE
**Key Outputs**:
- Question generation algorithms
- Domain-specific question databases
- Contextual enrichment system

### **Story 1.3: Progressive Disclosure and Expertise Tracking**
**File**: `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.3.md` (currently open)
**Purpose**: User expertise tracking and adaptive complexity
**Depends**: Stories 1.1-1.2 COMPLETE
**Key Outputs**:
- Expertise tracking system

- Conversation memory management

### **Story 1.4: User Interface Integration and Experience**
**File**: `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.4.md`
**Purpose**: Seamless UI integration with existing interface
**Depends**: Stories 1.1-1.3 COMPLETE
**Key Outputs**:
- Questioning UI components
- Integration with existing domain detection UI
- Responsive design implementation

### **Story 1.5: CopilotKit Action Enhancement and Performance Optimization**
**File**: `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.5.md`
**Purpose**: Production-ready action integration and optimization
**Depends**: Stories 1.1-1.4 COMPLETE
**Key Outputs**:
- CopilotKit action integration
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness

## Technical Architecture Overview

**Existing System (DO NOT MODIFY)**:
```typescript
// Current domain detection system at app/src/lib/domain/
- domainDetectionSystem.ts (92% accuracy, <3s response)
- multiSourceKnowledge.ts (caching infrastructure)
- DomainExpertiseProvider (React context)
- 11 operational CopilotKit actions
```

**New Enhancement System (ADDITIVE ONLY)**:
```typescript
// New questioning system at app/src/lib/enhanced/
- questioning/ (question generation, expertise tracking)
- hooks/ (React hooks for questioning functionality)
- types/ (TypeScript interfaces for questioning)
```

## Implementation Constraints

### **HARD CONSTRAINTS** (NEVER VIOLATE)
1. **Zero Modification Rule**: Never modify existing domain detection files
2. **Performance Requirements**: Maintain <3s response time for domain detection
3. **Composition Pattern**: All enhancements via composition, not modification
4. **Feature Flag Control**: All new functionality controllable via feature flags
5. **Rollback Safety**: Complete rollback must be possible at any time

### **Architecture Patterns**
- **Brownfield Enhancement**: Preserve 100% existing functionality
- **Progressive Implementation**: Each story builds on previous foundations
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and rollback procedures
- **Safety First**: Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Current Project State

**Working Directory**: `a:\langflow\langflow-architect\`
**Package Manager**: npm (check package.json for scripts)
**Development Environment**: Windows with PowerShell
**Available Tasks**: Init, Backend, Frontend, Test, Lint, Format

## Implementation Instructions

### **STEP 1: System Discovery** (IMMEDIATE)
1. Read `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.1.md` completely
2. Explore existing domain detection system at `app/src/lib/domain/`
3. Review current `DomainExpertiseProvider` implementation
4. Understand existing TypeScript interfaces and patterns

### **STEP 2: Foundation Implementation** (Story 1.1)
1. Create enhanced context provider extending existing domain context
2. Implement feature flag infrastructure for questioning system
3. Add TypeScript interfaces for questioning system
4. Set up composition pattern for brownfield enhancement
5. Verify zero impact on existing domain detection

### **STEP 3: Verification and Testing**
1. Run existing tests to ensure no regression
2. Test domain detection continues working identically
3. Verify feature flags can disable all new functionality
4. Confirm enhanced context integrates seamlessly

### **STEP 4: Progress and Continue**
1. Mark Story 1.1 as COMPLETE with verification
2. Move to Story 1.2 implementation
3. Maintain systematic progression through all 5 stories
4. Test integration at each story completion

## Success Criteria for Story 1.1

**Story 1.1 is COMPLETE when**:
1. Enhanced `DomainExpertiseProvider` extends existing context without modification
2. Feature flag infrastructure allows complete questioning system control
3. TypeScript interfaces support full questioning system architecture
4. Existing domain detection works identically with enhancements present
5. All new code follows composition pattern with zero modification

## Development Environment Setup

**Before Starting**:
```powershell
# Ensure you're in the correct directory
cd a:\langflow\langflow-architect\

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Run tests to establish baseline
npm test

# Check linting
npm run lint
```

## Communication Protocol

**Status Updates**: Provide clear progress updates after each major task completion
**Issue Resolution**: If blockers encountered, explain the issue and proposed solutions
**Testing Results**: Report test results and verification steps completed
**Story Completion**: Confirm each story meets all acceptance criteria before proceeding

## Emergency Procedures

**If Issues Arise**:
1. **Feature Flag Disable**: Immediately disable questioning features via flags
2. **Rollback**: Revert to previous working state maintaining existing functionality
3. **Issue Documentation**: Document specific problems for resolution
4. **Safety First**: Never compromise existing domain detection functionality
