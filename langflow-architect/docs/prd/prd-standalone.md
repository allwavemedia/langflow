# Socratic Langflow Architect - Standalone Application PRD

## 1. Goals and Background Context

This document outlines the requirements for the "Socratic Langflow Architect," a **standalone AI-powered web application** designed to guide non-technical users through the creation of Langflow workflows. The application operates independently from the main Langflow platform and features a modern chatbot interface powered by GPT-5.

The primary goal is to translate user intent into a functional Langflow JSON file and provide step-by-step instructions for implementation via an inquiry-based, conversational process. The agent serves as an expert partner, making advanced AI workflow creation accessible to a broader audience through an intuitive, web-based chat interface.

### Key Architectural Principles:
- **Standalone Application**: Completely independent from Langflow core application
- **Modern Chat Interface**: Professional CopilotKit-powered conversational UI with streaming
- **Next.js + CopilotKit**: Leverages React framework with pre-built AI chat components
- **GPT-5 Integration**: Enhanced reasoning through CopilotKit's OpenAI integration
- **Export-Focused**: Generates complete Langflow JSON files ready for import
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Provides detailed implementation instructions via CopilotKit actions

## 2. Technical Architecture Overview

### Frontend Stack:
- **UI Framework**: Next.js 14+ with React and TypeScript
- **AI Interface**: CopilotKit for professional chat components (CopilotChat, CopilotSidebar)
- **Features**: Real-time streaming chat, live workflow preview via generative UI, progress tracking, JSON export

### Backend Stack:
- **API Framework**: Next.js API Routes with CopilotKit Runtime
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-5 via CopilotKit's built-in integration
- **Conversation Management**: CopilotKit conversation state management
- **State Management**: CopilotKit runtime with persistent session storage

### Deployment:
- **Platform**: Vercel (unified frontend + backend deployment)
- **Storage**: Vercel KV (Redis-compatible) for session management
- **Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics with integrated error tracking
- **Database**: SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production)
