# PRD Index — Sharded PRDs

This folder contains sharded PRDs for parts of the project. Per BMAD configuration the canonical PRD index is `docs/prd.md` which points to sharded PRDs located in `docs/prd/`.

Sharded PRDs in this repository:

- `docs/prd/langflow-architect.md` — Product Requirements Document for the langflow-architect app (app-level PRD).
- `docs/prd/epic-6-brownfield-advanced-socratic.md` — Brownfield PRD for Epic 6.4.3 Advanced Socratic Questioning.

Edit the corresponding file inside `docs/prd/` and follow BMAD PRD conventions (header metadata, goals, epics, acceptance criteria, appendix).
