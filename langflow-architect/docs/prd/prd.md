Socratic Langflow Architect - Product Requirements Document (PRD)1. Goals and Background ContextThis document outlines the requirements for the "Socratic Langflow Architect," an AI agent designed to guide non-technical users through the creation of Langflow workflows. The primary goal is to translate user intent into a functional Langflow JSON file and a clear, beginner-friendly user guide via an inquiry-based, conversational process. The agent will serve as an expert partner, making advanced AI workflow creation accessible to a broader audience.2. RequirementsFunctional Requirements (FR)FR1: The agent must initiate conversation by offering common workflow categories (e.g., "chatbot," "data analysis," "RAG workflow") to provide a clear starting point.FR2: The agent must be able to ask clarifying, Socratic questions to progressively refine user requirements from an abstract goal into a concrete specification.FR3: The agent must autonomously use its integrated web browsing tool to research potential solutions, Langflow components, and technical trade-offs in real-time.FR4: When multiple valid implementation paths exist, the agent must present the options and their trade-offs to the user in the form of a question, including a reasoned recommendation.FR5: The agent must be able to generate a valid, importable Langflow JSON file that accurately represents the finalized, co-designed workflow.FR6: The agent must generate a numbered, step-by-step user guide written for a complete beginner, explaining how to import and use the generated JSON file.FR7: The agent must have a contingency protocol to make a definitive, reasoned choice if the user expresses indecision, ensuring the conversation does not stall.Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)NFR1: The generated Langflow JSON must adhere to the latest stable schema for the platform to ensure import compatibility.NFR2: The agent's conversational persona must be consistently patient, encouraging, and supportive, avoiding overly technical jargon.NFR3: The agent must include a security disclaimer when suggesting solutions that involve custom Python code, advising the user of potential risks.3. Epic ListEpic 1: Core Socratic Engine & Interaction Loop: Establish the agent's persona, conversational abilities, and the primary loop of listening, questioning, and refining user intent.Epic 2: Autonomous Research & Synthesis: Integrate the agent's tools for real-time information gathering and develop the logic for synthesizing and presenting findings to the user as clear choices.Epic 3: Final Artifact Generation: Develop the capability to generate the final, validated Langflow JSON and the detailed, beginner-friendly user guide based on the completed conversation.4. Epic 1: Core Socratic Engine & Interaction LoopGoal: To build the foundational conversational capabilities of the agent, enabling it to guide a user through the initial stages of workflow definition using its Socratic persona.Story 1.1: Initial Interaction & FramingAs a user, I want to be greeted and offered common workflow categories, so that I have a clear starting point for our conversation.Acceptance Criteria:On first interaction, the agent introduces itself as the "Socratic Langflow Architect."The agent presents at least four common workflow categories as numbered options.Story 1.2: Basic Inquiry LoopAs a user, I want the agent to ask me questions about my goals instead of waiting for me to provide all the details, so that I feel guided in the process.Acceptance Criteria:After I select a category, the agent asks a high-level open-ended question about my objective.The agent can parse my natural language response to identify key concepts.The agent's next response is a clarifying question, not a proposed solution.5. Epic 2: Autonomous Research & SynthesisGoal: To empower the agent with the ability to perform autonomous research, analyze the findings, and present them to the user as clear, actionable choices.Story 2.1: Tool Integration - Web BrowsingAs a developer, I want the agent to be able to use a web browsing tool, so that it can find up-to-date information on Langflow components and best practices.Acceptance Criteria:The agent can formulate a search query based on the user's stated goal.The agent can execute the search and parse the results.The agent can identify relevant information (e.g., component names, required parameters) from the search results.Story 2.2: Decision Point PresentationAs a user, I want the agent to explain the options it finds and their trade-offs, so that I can make an informed decision.Acceptance Criteria:When research yields multiple valid paths, the agent summarizes the options.The summary includes the primary trade-offs (e.g., complexity vs. performance).The agent's response is structured as a question asking for my preference and includes a recommendation.Story 2.3: Contingency Protocol for IndecisionAs a user, I want the agent to be able to make a choice for me if I'm stuck, so that the process doesn't stall.Acceptance Criteria:If I respond with "I don't know" or "you choose," the agent selects one of the presented options.The agent must state which option it chose and briefly explain its reasoning based on our conversation.6. Epic 3: Final Artifact GenerationGoal: To build the final output capabilities of the agent, ensuring it can deliver a complete, functional, and well-documented solution to the user.Story 3.1: Langflow JSON GenerationAs a user, I want to receive a complete and valid Langflow JSON file, so that I can directly import it into the platform.Acceptance Criteria:The agent can construct a JSON object representing the entire workflow graph based on the finalized requirements.The generated JSON validates against the Langflow schema.The JSON is presented within a formatted code block for easy copying.Story 3.2: Beginner's User Guide GenerationAs a user, I want to receive a step-by-step guide on how to use the generated file, so that I know exactly what to do next.Acceptance Criteria:The agent generates a numbered list of instructions.The guide is written in simple, non-technical language, assuming no prior knowledge.The guide includes steps for importing the JSON and any necessary subsequent setup (e.g., adding API keys).
