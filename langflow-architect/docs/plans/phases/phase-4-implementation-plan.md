- **Knowledge Activation**: Automatic switching between specialized domain knowledge
- **Component Recommendations**: Domain-specific component suggestions
- **Industry Patterns**: Healthcare, finance, manufacturing, education, e-commerce

#### Architecture Requirements
```typescript
interface DomainDetectionEngine {
  analyzeConversation(context: ConversationContext): DetectedDomain[];
  activateDomainKnowledge(domain: Domain): DomainKnowledgeBase;
  getComponentRecommendations(domain: Domain, requirements: string[]): ComponentSuggestion[];
}
```

#### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Domain detection algorithm development
- **Week 2**: Knowledge base integration and activation
- **Week 3**: Component recommendation engine
- **Week 4**: Testing and validation

### 2. Compliance Intelligence Engine (Priority 2)
**Goal**: Real-time compliance guidance for regulated industries

#### Regulatory Frameworks
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection and workflow compliance
- **GDPR**: Data privacy and protection regulations
- **SOX**: Financial reporting and data integrity requirements
- **PCI-DSS**: Payment card industry security standards
- **FDA**: Medical device and pharmaceutical compliance

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface ComplianceEngine {
  validateWorkflow(workflow: WorkflowConfig, regulations: Regulation[]): ComplianceReport;
  getComplianceWarnings(components: Component[]): Warning[];
  generateComplianceDocumentation(workflow: WorkflowConfig): ComplianceDoc;
}
```

#### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Regulatory framework research and pattern identification
- **Week 3-4**: Compliance validation engine development
- **Week 5-6**: Integration with workflow generation and testing

### 3. Advanced Socratic Questioning (Priority 3)
**Goal**: Adaptive questioning based on user expertise and domain

#### Questioning Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complexity adjustment based on user responses
- **Domain-Specific Elicitation**: Industry-specific requirement gathering
- **Expertise Detection**: Automatic adjustment to user's technical level
- **Context-Aware Flow**: Intelligent conversation progression

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface SocraticEngine {
  generateQuestions(context: ConversationContext, domain: Domain): Question[];
  assessUserExpertise(responses: UserResponse[]): ExpertiseLevel;
  adaptQuestionComplexity(expertise: ExpertiseLevel): QuestionComplexity;
}
```

#### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Question generation algorithms
- **Week 2**: Expertise assessment patterns
- **Week 3**: Adaptive complexity adjustment
- **Week 4**: Integration and testing

### 4. Code Quality Optimization (Priority 4)
**Goal**: Complete code quality optimization and technical debt resolution

#### Current Issues (16 ESLint warnings)
- Unused variables and imports
- Explicit `any` types requiring proper typing
- Code structure optimization opportunities

#### Resolution Plan
- **Week 1**: ESLint warning resolution
- **Week 2**: Type safety improvements
- **Week 3**: Code structure optimization
- **Week 4**: Performance testing and validation

## Technical Architecture

### Enhanced Context Engine
```typescript
interface EnhancedContextEngine {
  // Domain detection
  detectDomain(conversation: ConversationContext): Domain;
  
  // Compliance checking
  validateCompliance(workflow: WorkflowConfig): ComplianceStatus;
  
  // Adaptive questioning
  generateAdaptiveQuestions(userProfile: UserProfile): Question[];
  
  // Knowledge integration
  integrateKnowledge(domain: Domain, compliance: Regulation[]): KnowledgeBase;
}
```

### Integration Points
- **CopilotKit Actions**: Enhanced actions for domain-specific guidance
- **Conversation Context**: Persistent domain and compliance state
- **GitHub Documentation**: Domain-specific component documentation
- **MCP Servers**: Specialized domain knowledge sources

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 4.1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Enhanced Context Engine**: Upgrade existing context management
2. **Domain Detection Core**: Basic domain identification algorithms
3. **Compliance Framework**: Regulatory pattern definitions

### Phase 4.2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
1. **Domain Knowledge Activation**: Automatic expertise switching
2. **Compliance Validation**: Real-time regulatory checking
3. **Adaptive Questioning**: Progressive disclosure patterns

### Phase 4.3: Integration (Weeks 7-8)
1. **CopilotKit Integration**: Enhanced actions deployment
2. **Testing and Validation**: Comprehensive feature testing
3. **Documentation**: User guides and developer documentation

## Success Metrics
