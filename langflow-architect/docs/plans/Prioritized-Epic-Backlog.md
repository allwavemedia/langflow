# Prioritized Epic Backlog

## Purpose

This document contains the official, prioritized list of the 10 core epics for the Langflow Architect project. This prioritized backlog was established on 2025-09-01 by the Product Owner in consultation with key stakeholders. It will serve as the strategic roadmap guiding our development sprints and resource allocation.

The prioritization is based on delivering maximum user value early, ensuring stability and security, and then focusing on long-term enhancements and sustainability.
