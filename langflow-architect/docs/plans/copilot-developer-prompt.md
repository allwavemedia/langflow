# GitHub Copilot Developer Agent Prompt: Systematic Story Validation Improvement

## BMad Framework Integration

**Always reference and utilize the BMad framework** throughout your development process:

### Core BMad Resources
- **Configuration**: `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` - Central BMad settings and MCP integration
- **Workflows**: `bmad-core/workflows/` - Specialized development workflows (brownfield-fullstack recommended)  
- **Agents**: `bmad-core/agents/` - Agent definitions for SM (Bob), PM (John), Architect, Dev, QA
- **Checklists**: `bmad-core/checklists/` - Quality validation frameworks and standards

### BMad Command Usage
When coordinating improvements, leverage BMad commands:
- `*agent [role]` - Transform into specialized agent (sm, pm, architect, dev, qa)
- `*workflow brownfield-fullstack` - Execute enhancement workflow for existing projects
- `*story-checklist` - Apply 5-category validation framework
- `*plan [objective]` - Generate strategic improvement plans

### BMad Methodology Benefits
- **Systematic Approach**: Structured workflows prevent ad-hoc fixes
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation frameworks ensure standards
- **Agent Coordination**: Specialized roles optimize task execution
- **Scalable Process**: Framework adapts to project complexity

**Integration Requirement**: Reference BMad framework components, follow established workflows, and utilize agent specializations throughout all improvement activities.

## Development Context

You are assisting with the **Langflow Architect project**, a sophisticated AI-powered application that guides users through Langflow workflow creation. The project uses **BMad methodology** with specialized agents for different roles (Product Manager, Scrum Master, Architect, Developer, QA).

## Current Situation

A comprehensive **story validation assessment** was completed across 31 user stories in 7 epics, revealing quality inconsistencies that need systematic improvement. A **3-phase improvement plan** has been created to address these issues without disrupting active development.

### Key Findings
- **61% of stories** are ready for development
- **26% need minor revision** (reference quality, testing guidance)
- **13% require major updates** (Epic 2 superseded, Epic 6.4 lacks technical detail)

## Your Mission

Help implement the **Systematic Story Validation Improvement Plan** by:

1. **Analyzing the current state** of story quality issues
2. **Prioritizing next actions** based on development impact
3. **Coordinating improvements** across the 3-phase timeline
4. **Maintaining development momentum** while improving quality
5. **Following BMad methodology** by referencing and utilizing the BMad framework throughout

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### üö® PHASE 1: CRITICAL RESOLUTION (Week 1)

#### Priority 1A: Epic 2 Migration Strategy (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Epic 2 stories reference outdated architecture patterns - they've been superseded by Epic 5's enhanced agent intelligence architecture.

**Required Actions**:
1. **Update Epic 2 Header**:
   - Add "SUPERSEDED BY EPIC 5" notice
   - Explain migration rationale
   - Reference Epic 5 as current architecture

2. **Story Reference Migration**:
   - Map Epic 2 concepts to Epic 5 equivalents:
     - Story 2.1 (Category Framework) ‚Üí Story 5.1 (Context Understanding)
     - Story 2.2 (Question Generation) ‚Üí Story 5.6 (Advanced Questions)
     - Story 2.3 (Real-Time Construction) ‚Üí Enhanced Epic 3
     - etc.

3. **Create Migration Documentation**:
   - Document architectural evolution
   - Provide developer guidance for current patterns

#### Priority 1B: Epic 6.4 Technical Enhancement (HIGH)
**Problem**: Epic 6.4 stories lack sufficient technical detail to enable Phase 6.4 development.

**Required Actions**:
1. **Add Component Specifications**:
   - Specific file paths and locations
   - Integration with existing Epic 5 context engine
   - CopilotKit action integration patterns

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Required environment variables
   - Configuration file specifications
   - MCP server integration setup

3. **Testing Enhancement**:
   - Domain expertise test scenarios
   - Compliance validation test cases
   - Integration testing with Epic 5 components

## Technology Stack Context

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.5.0 + CopilotKit 1.10.2
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT + CopilotKit actions
- **Architecture**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel-optimized

## Available BMad Resources

### Agents Available for Coordination
- **Bob (Scrum Master)**: Story validation, epic management (`*agent sm`)
- **John (Product Manager)**: Strategic planning, PRD creation (`*agent pm`)
- **Winston (Architect)**: Technical architecture guidance (`*agent architect`)
- **QA Agent**: Code review and quality validation (`*agent qa`)

### Key BMad Commands
- `*workflow brownfield-fullstack` - For coordinating enhancements
- `*agent [name]` - Transform into specialist agent
- `*task [task-name]` - Execute specific improvement tasks
- `*plan` - Create detailed implementation plans

## Decision Framework

When choosing what to do next, prioritize based on:

### üî• **Critical (Do First)**
- Issues that block Phase 6.4 development
- Epic 2 superseded references causing confusion
- Story 6.1 completion (Tasks 2-6 remaining)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **High Priority**
- Stories graded B- or lower needing technical detail
- Reference quality standardization
- Testing guidance enhancement

### üìù **Medium Priority**
- Cross-epic dependency documentation
- Technical implementation consistency
- Quality standard establishment

## Recommended Next Actions

Based on the current state and improvement plan, here are your options:

### Option 1: Complete Active Sprint (RECOMMENDED)
**Focus**: Finish Story 6.1 MCP Marketplace implementation
**Rationale**: 
- Foundation complete with 20 passing tests
- Tasks 2-6 are well-defined and ready
- Delivers immediate user value
- Provides infrastructure for Epic 6.4

**Action**: 
```bash
*agent dev
# Then work on Story 6.1 tasks: search, filters, preview, CopilotKit integration
```

### Option 2: Resolve Critical Story Issues
**Focus**: Fix Epic 2 superseded references and enhance Epic 6.4
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates major development blockers
- Prepares Epic 6.4 for implementation
- Addresses highest-impact validation failures

**Action**:
```bash
*agent pm
*task create-brownfield-epic  # For Epic 6.4 enhancement
```

### Option 3: Systematic Quality Improvement
**Focus**: Implement full 3-phase improvement plan
**Rationale**:
- Addresses all validation issues comprehensively
- Establishes sustainable quality patterns
- Long-term project health improvement

**Action**:
```bash
*workflow brownfield-fullstack
# Then follow systematic improvement plan phases
```

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should achieve:

### Phase 1 Success (Week 1)
- ‚úÖ Epic 2 clearly marked as superseded with Epic 5 references
- ‚úÖ Epic 6.4 stories achieve "READY" validation status
- ‚úÖ Zero development blockers related to story quality

### Overall Project Success
- üéØ **Validation Score**: Improve from B+ to A-
- üéØ **Development Readiness**: 90%+ stories ready for implementation
- üéØ **Process Sustainability**: Quality standards maintainable

## Quality Standards Reference

Use **Epic 5: Enhanced Agent Intelligence** as the gold standard for:
- Technical implementation detail
- Reference quality and effectiveness
- Testing guidance comprehensiveness
- Self-contained story structure

## Your Decision

Given this context, **what do you recommend as the next action?**

Consider:
1. **Current project momentum** (Story 6.1 in progress)
2. **Critical blocking issues** (Epic 2 superseded, Epic 6.4 lacking detail)
3. **Resource availability** and coordination with other agents
4. **Impact on upcoming Phase 6.4 implementation**

**Provide your recommendation with rationale, then coordinate with the appropriate BMad agent to execute the chosen approach.**
