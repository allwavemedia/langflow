# LangFlow Architect — Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Status: In-development

## Purpose

This PRD captures goals, stakeholders, success metrics, key features, constraints, and acceptance criteria for the `langflow-architect` project — the Next.js-based architect app and supporting tooling found in the `langflow-architect/app` folder.

## Context

`langflow-architect` is a curated front-end and integration/test harness for the larger LangFlow platform. It bundles a Next.js app, Playwright/Jest test suites, CI config, and deployment artifacts to validate and demonstrate platform capabilities.

## Objectives

- Provide a stable, developer-friendly Next.js UI for composing and demonstrating LangFlow flows.
- Ship repeatable CI (unit, integration, e2e) with reproducible Docker images and smoke tests.
- Provide clear docs and quickstart scripts for local development and production deployments.

## Success Metrics

- Developer onboarding time: < 60 minutes from clone to running the app locally.
- CI: green test runs for PRs on `dev` and `main` for critical flows.
- Production: CI builds reproducible container images that pass smoke tests.

## Target Users

- Frontend engineers, product engineers, QA engineers, and platform/DevOps.

## MVP Requirements

- Responsive TypeScript Next.js app in `app/`.
- Local dev scripts and `.env` examples.
- Unit, integration and e2e tests (Jest/Playwright) configured.
- Dockerfiles and deployment manifests (Render/docker-compose).
- README, PRD, and Architecture docs.

## Non-functional Requirements

- Secrets must be provided through environment variables; no secrets in repo.
- Health endpoints for smoke tests.
- Reasonable performance for primary routes in CI.

## Acceptance Criteria

- App builds and runs locally with documented steps.
- CI runs tests and passes on PRs.
- Docker images are buildable and runnable with `docker-compose`.

## Risks

- API contract drift with backend — add contract tests and integration harnesses.
- Flaky e2e tests — stabilize test data and add retries/artifacts.

## Appendix

See `langflow-architect/app/README.md`, `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `playwright.config.ts`, and `jest.config.js` for implementation-level details.
