# Story Quality Validation Checklist

This checklist provides a standardized set of criteria for validating user stories, ensuring they meet the quality standards required for development.

## 1. Story Definition
- [x] **Clarity**: Is the user story clear, concise, and unambiguous?
- [x] **Role-Goal-Benefit**: Does the story follow the "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format?
- [x] **Atomic**: Is the story small enough to be completed within a single sprint?

## 2. Acceptance Criteria
- [x] **Testable**: Are the acceptance criteria specific, measurable, and testable?
- [x] **Comprehensive**: Do the criteria cover all expected outcomes, including edge cases and error conditions?
- [x] **User-Centric**: Are the criteria defined from the user's perspective?

## 3. Technical Requirements
- [x] **Specificity**: Are the technical requirements detailed enough for a developer to begin implementation?
- [x] **Feasibility**: Are the requirements technically feasible within the project's constraints?
- [x] **Dependencies**: Are all technical dependencies (e.g., APIs, libraries) identified?

## 4. Testing
- [x] **Strategy**: Is a clear testing strategy defined (unit, integration, E2E)?
- [x] **Coverage**: Does the testing plan cover all acceptance criteria?
- [x] **Location**: Is the location for test files specified?

## 5. Definition of Done
- [x] **Alignment**: Does the Definition of Done align with the project's overall quality standards?
- [x] **Completeness**: Does it include all necessary steps, such as code review, testing, and deployment?

## 6. References
- [x] **Relevance**: Are all references relevant and necessary for understanding the story?
- [x] **Accessibility**: Are all links to references valid and accessible?
- [x] **Formatting**: Do references follow the standard format (`docs/filename.md#section`)?
