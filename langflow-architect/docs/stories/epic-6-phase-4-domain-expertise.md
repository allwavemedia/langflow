# Epic 6 Phase 4: Advanced Domain Expertise & Compliance Intelligence

## User Stories

### Story 6.4.1: Intelligent Domain Detection System
**As a** workflow designer  
**I want** automatic domain expertise activation based on conversation context  
**So that** I receive specialized guidance for my industry (healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc.)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System automatically detects domain keywords and patterns
- [ ] Context engine activates domain-specific knowledge bases
- [ ] Specialized component recommendations appear for detected domains
- [ ] Domain expertise persists across conversation sessions

#### Technical Requirements
- Implement conversation context analysis for domain detection
- Create domain-specific knowledge activation patterns
- Build specialized component recommendation engine
- Ensure seamless domain switching without context loss

#### Component Specifications
- **`DomainDetectionProvider`**: React context provider to manage and distribute the detected domain state across the application.
- **`useDomain` hook**: Custom hook to provide components with access to the current domain, its knowledge base, and specialized configurations.
- **`ContextAnalyzerService`**: Singleton TypeScript service to analyze conversation history against domain keyword patterns.

#### Environment Configuration
- `REACT_APP_DOMAIN_KEYWORDS_URL`: URL pointing to a JSON file containing domain keywords, patterns, and configurations.

#### Testing Scenarios
- **Unit**: Test `ContextAnalyzerService` with mock conversation data to verify accurate domain detection.
- **Integration**: Ensure `DomainDetectionProvider` updates and provides state correctly when conversation context changes.
- **E2E**: Simulate a full user conversation and assert that domain-specific UI elements and recommendations appear as expected.

#### BMad Commands
```bash
*agent analyst
*task create-domain-detection-system
```

### Story 6.4.2: Compliance Intelligence Engine
**As a** workflow designer in a regulated industry  
**I want** real-time compliance guidance and validation  
**So that** my workflows automatically meet regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, etc.)

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time compliance validation for applicable regulations
- [ ] Automatic compliance warnings for non-compliant patterns
- [ ] Regulatory best practices integrated into component selection
- [ ] Compliance documentation generated with workflows

#### Technical Requirements
- Implement HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, FDA validation patterns
- Create compliance-aware workflow recommendations
- Build regulatory best practices database
- Ensure compliance tracking across workflow lifecycle

#### Component Specifications
- **`ComplianceProvider`**: React context provider to manage and distribute compliance state, including detected regulations and validation results.
- **`useCompliance` hook**: Custom hook for components to access real-time validation status and trigger compliance checks.
- **`ValidationService`**: Singleton TypeScript service containing validation logic for HIPAA, GDPR, SOX, etc.
- **`ComplianceWarning`**: UI component to display non-compliance warnings and suggestions.

#### Environment Configuration
- `REACT_APP_COMPLIANCE_RULES_URL`: URL to a JSON file with up-to-date compliance rules and patterns.

#### Testing Scenarios
- **Unit**: Test `ValidationService` with mock workflow data to verify correct identification of compliance violations.
- **Integration**: Ensure `ComplianceProvider` correctly updates state when workflow changes trigger re-validation.
- **E2E**: Simulate building a non-compliant workflow and assert that `ComplianceWarning` appears with actionable advice.

#### BMad Commands
```bash
*agent architect
*task design-compliance-engine
```

### Story 6.4.3: Advanced Socratic Questioning
**As a** user with varying technical expertise  
**I want** adaptive questioning based on my knowledge level and domain  
**So that** I receive appropriate guidance without overwhelming complexity

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progressive disclosure patterns based on user expertise
- [ ] Domain-specific elicitation patterns for specialized industries
- [ ] Intelligent conversation flow adapts to user responses
- [ ] Context-aware question generation using conversation intelligence

#### Technical Requirements
- Implement adaptive questioning based on detected user expertise
- Create domain-specific elicitation patterns
- Build intelligent conversation flow management
- Ensure context-aware question generation

#### Component Specifications
- **`QuestionProvider`**: React context provider to manage the state of the adaptive questioning flow.
- **`useQuestion` hook**: Custom hook for components to access the current question set and provide user responses.
- **`QuestionGenerationService`**: Singleton TypeScript service that uses conversation context to generate and adapt questions.
- **`AdaptiveQuestion`**: UI component that renders questions with appropriate complexity and provides input controls.

#### Environment Configuration
- `REACT_APP_QUESTION_PATTERNS_URL`: URL to a JSON file containing domain-specific and expertise-leveled question patterns.

#### Testing Scenarios
- **Unit**: Test `QuestionGenerationService` to verify that it generates progressively more specific questions based on mock context.
- **Integration**: Ensure `QuestionProvider` correctly manages state and adapts the question flow based on user input.
- **E2E**: Simulate a full conversation with a user persona and assert that the questioning adapts to their expertise level.

#### BMad Commands
```bash
*workflow domain-expertise
*plan
```

### Story 6.4.4: Code Quality Optimization
**As a** developer working on the Langflow Architect  
**I want** complete code quality optimization  
**So that** the codebase maintains high standards and performance

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 16 ESLint warnings resolved
- [ ] Cognitive complexity optimization completed
- [ ] Type safety improvements (remove explicit any types)
- [ ] Unused variables and imports cleaned up

#### Technical Requirements
- Complete cognitive complexity optimization
- Resolve remaining ESLint warnings (unused vars, explicit any types)
- Improve type safety and code structure
- Ensure build performance optimization

#### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1: Baseline & Autofix**
  - Generate ESLint and complexity reports to establish a baseline.
  - Run Prettier and ESLint autofix to resolve formatting and simple lint issues.
- **Phase 2: Manual Remediation**
  - Systematically replace `any` types with specific types or generics.
  - Refactor functions with high cognitive complexity.
  - Remove all unused variables and imports identified by the linter.
- **Phase 3: CI Enforcement**
  - Configure the CI pipeline to fail on any ESLint warning or TypeScript error.
  - Add a build step to verify that cognitive complexity does not regress.

#### BMad Commands
```bash
*agent dev
*task code-quality-optimization
```
