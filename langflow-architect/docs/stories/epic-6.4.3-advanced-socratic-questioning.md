# Story: Advanced Socratic Questioning System

<!-- Source: Development Completion Plan - Epic 6.4.3 -->
<!-- Context: Brownfield enhancement to Langflow Architect (70% complete) -->

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a **Langflow workflow designer**,
I want **adaptive Socratic questioning that adjusts to my domain expertise and project context**,
so that **I can receive progressively sophisticated guidance that helps me discover optimal workflow patterns without overwhelming me with irrelevant details**.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: Development Completion Plan - Epic 6.4.3
- **Enhancement Type**: Advanced UX feature addition with AI-driven questioning
- **Existing System Impact**: Integrates with completed Dynamic Domain Detection System (Epic 6.4.1)
- **Foundation**: Built on 92% accurate domain detection with multi-source knowledge integration

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Functionality

1. **Adaptive Questioning**: System generates contextually relevant questions based on detected domain and user expertise level
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Questions increase in sophistication as user demonstrates deeper knowledge  
3. **Dynamic Elicitation**: Questions adapt in real-time to discovered domain patterns without hardcoded rules
4. **Context Awareness**: Questions reference current workflow state, detected domain, and conversation history

### Brownfield Safety Requirements

1. **Domain Detection Integration**: Existing `domainDetectionSystem.ts` continues to work unchanged
2. **Performance Preservation**: Domain detection response time remains <3s (currently 2.1s)
3. **MCP Compatibility**: Existing MCP server integrations maintain current functionality
4. **CopilotKit Integration**: Current 11 operational CopilotKit actions remain functional

### Quality Gates

1. **User Satisfaction**: >85% satisfaction across any discovered domain
2. **Zero Hardcoded Patterns**: No domain-specific questioning logic hardcoded
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if MCP or web search is unavailable
4. **TypeScript Compliance**: Maintains A- grade quality standards

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Completed Foundation (Epic 6.4.1)**:

- `domainDetectionSystem.ts` - 92% accuracy domain detection with multi-source knowledge
- `DomainExpertiseProvider` - React context for domain state management  
- `multiSourceKnowledge.ts` - Multi-source knowledge aggregation with caching
- Demo available at `/demo/domain-intelligence`
- 11 operational CopilotKit actions for workflow assistance

**Integration Points**:

- Domain detection provides: domain, confidence, indicators, knowledge synthesis
- Multi-source knowledge provides: concepts, technologies, best practices, patterns
- CopilotKit actions provide: workflow context and user interaction patterns

### SM Agent's Recommendations for Safe Implementation

Based on brownfield analysis, I recommend these integration approaches:

#### 1. **Leverage Existing Domain Context**

- Use `DomainExpertiseProvider` React context to access current domain state
- Build questioning on top of existing domain knowledge rather than replacing it
- Integrate with `multiSourceKnowledge.queryMultipleSources()` for question enrichment

#### 2. **Follow Established Patterns**

- Reference Epic 5 patterns for existing questioning intelligence (if available)
- Use existing CopilotKit action patterns for consistent user experience
- Follow component placement guidelines from completed quality standards

#### 3. **Performance-First Approach**

- Leverage existing caching in `multiSourceKnowledge` for question generation
- Use domain detection confidence scores to optimize question complexity
- Implement progressive loading to maintain <3s response targets

#### 4. **Graceful Integration Strategy**

- Create new questioning module that extends rather than modifies existing domain detection
- Use composition pattern to add questioning without breaking current functionality
- Implement feature flags for safe rollout and easy rollback

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Questioning system interferes with existing domain detection performance
- **Mitigation**: Use composition pattern and separate performance monitoring for questioning vs domain detection
- **Verification**: Continuous performance testing during development with <3s response time requirement

- **Secondary Risk**: Questioning logic becomes domain-specific instead of generalist
- **Mitigation**: Build all question generation on top of dynamic domain knowledge, never hardcode domain patterns
- **Verification**: Test questioning across multiple domains to ensure generalist approach

- **Integration Risk**: Changes break existing CopilotKit actions or domain detection functionality  
- **Mitigation**: Use extension patterns rather than modification, maintain backward compatibility
- **Verification**: Full regression testing of existing 11 CopilotKit actions and domain detection demo

### Rollback Plan

- Feature flag questioning system for instant disable if issues arise
- Questioning components designed as optional enhancements to existing domain detection
- Database/state changes isolated to questioning functionality only
- Existing domain detection and CopilotKit actions remain fully functional without questioning

### Safety Checks

- [ ] Domain detection accuracy tested before and after questioning integration
- [ ] All existing CopilotKit actions verified functional with questioning enabled
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained throughout development process
- [ ] Feature flag implemented for safe production rollout

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Recommended Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Extend existing domain detection without modification
interface SocraticQuestioningEnhancement {
  // Build on existing domain context
  domainContext: EnhancedDomainContext; // from existing system
  
  // Add questioning capabilities
  questionEngine: SocraticQuestionEngine;
  expertiseTracker: ExpertiseLevelTracker;
  progressiveDisclosure: ProgressiveDisclosureManager;
}

// Integration points with existing system
- Use: domainDetectionSystem.getActiveDomainContext()
- Use: multiSourceKnowledge.queryMultipleSources()  
- Extend: DomainExpertiseProvider with questioning state
