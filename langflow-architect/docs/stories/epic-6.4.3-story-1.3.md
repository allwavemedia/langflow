# Story 1.3: Progressive Disclosure and Expertise Tracking

<!-- Source: Brownfield PRD + Architecture Document -->
<!-- Context: Build upon Stories 1.1-1.2 to add sophisticated user adaptation -->

## Status: Ready for Implementation

## Story

As a **workflow designer with varying expertise levels**,  
I want **questions that adapt to my demonstrated knowledge and increase in sophistication appropriately**,  
so that **I'm guided progressively without being overwhelmed or under-challenged**.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: Brownfield PRD (docs/brownfield-prd-epic-6.4.3.md) + Architecture Document (docs/brownfield-architecture.md)
- **Enhancement Type**: Sophisticated user adaptation layer building on question generation engine
- **Existing System Impact**: Extends existing conversation analysis and domain expertise tracking
- **Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Foundation) and Story 1.2 (Question Generation) must be complete

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Objectives

1. **Expertise Detection**: System tracks user expertise level based on responses and domain indicators from existing conversation analysis

2. **Progressive Complexity**: Questions scale from beginner to advanced based on demonstrated user knowledge within detected domain

3. **Conversation Memory**: System remembers previous responses and adjusts future questions accordingly

4. **Fallback Handling**: Questions simplify if user responses indicate confusion or knowledge gaps

### Integration Verification Criteria

**IV1**: **Domain Context Compatibility**

- Expertise tracking integrates seamlessly with existing `DomainExpertiseProvider` React context
- Domain expertise indicators work alongside existing domain confidence metrics
- User expertise level updates don't interfere with domain detection accuracy

**IV2**: **State Management Verification**

- Progressive disclosure state doesn't interfere with existing domain switching functionality
- Expertise tracking persists correctly across domain changes
- Question sophistication adjusts appropriately when domains switch

**IV3**: **Memory Impact Verification**

- Conversation memory implementation doesn't exceed 20% memory usage increase from baseline
- Expertise tracking data structures remain performant under extended usage
- Memory cleanup occurs appropriately for long conversation sessions

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Foundation from Stories 1.1-1.2**:

- Enhanced `DomainExpertiseProvider` with questioning state management
- Core question generation engine with dynamic domain-based generation
- TypeScript interfaces for questioning system (`AdaptiveQuestion`, `SocraticQuestioningContext`)
- Feature flag infrastructure for safe activation

**Integration Points** (from brownfield-architecture.md):

- **Domain Expertise System**: Existing `DomainExpertiseProvider` for domain confidence tracking
- **Question Generation Engine**: Story 1.2 foundation for adaptive question creation
- **Conversation Analysis**: Existing conversation history and response patterns
- **Performance Constraints**: <20% memory increase, maintain <3s response times

### Implementation Approach

**Expertise Tracking Architecture**:

```typescript
// Expertise level tracking with domain awareness
interface ExpertiseTracker {
  analyzeUserResponse(
    response: UserResponse,
    question: AdaptiveQuestion,
    domainContext: DomainContext
  ): ExpertiseLevel;
  
  updateExpertiseProgression(
    userId: string,
    domain: string,
    newLevel: ExpertiseLevel
  ): void;
  
  getProgressiveComplexity(
    currentLevel: ExpertiseLevel,
    responseHistory: UserResponse[]
  ): SophisticationLevel;
  
  detectConfusionSignals(
    responses: UserResponse[]
  ): boolean;
}

// Progressive disclosure management
interface ProgressiveDisclosure {
  adjustQuestionSophistication(
    baseQuestion: AdaptiveQuestion,
    expertiseLevel: ExpertiseLevel,
    conversationContext: QuestionSession
  ): AdaptiveQuestion;
  
  determineNextQuestionLevel(
    currentLevel: ExpertiseLevel,
    responseQuality: ResponseQuality,
    domainConfidence: number
  ): SophisticationLevel;
}
```

**Integration with Existing Domain System**:

```typescript
// Extend existing domain context with expertise tracking
interface EnhancedDomainContext extends DomainExpertiseContext {
  questioningState: SocraticQuestioningContext;
  expertiseTracking: {
    currentLevel: ExpertiseLevel;
    progressionHistory: ExpertiseProgression[];
    domainSpecificLevels: Record<string, ExpertiseLevel>;
    confidenceIndicators: ExpertiseIndicators;
  };
  progressiveDisclosure: {
    currentSophistication: SophisticationLevel;
    adaptationStrategy: AdaptationStrategy;
    fallbackTriggers: FallbackCondition[];
  };
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

**Primary Risk**: Expertise tracking creating jarring sophistication jumps that confuse users  
**Mitigation**: Implement gradual sophistication transitions with user feedback validation  
**Verification**: User testing with sophistication progression scenarios

**Secondary Risk**: Conversation memory consuming excessive memory during long sessions  
**Mitigation**: Implement rolling memory windows and configurable retention limits  
**Verification**: Memory stress testing with extended conversation sessions

**Adaptation Risk**: Progressive disclosure interfering with existing domain detection user experience  
**Mitigation**: Maintain separate state management, add feature flag granular control  
**Verification**: Existing user workflow testing with progressive disclosure active

### Rollback Plan

**Immediate Rollback**:

1. Disable progressive disclosure via feature flag while maintaining basic question generation
2. Fallback to static sophistication level based on domain confidence
3. Clear conversation memory and restart with simplified questioning

**Partial Rollback**:

1. Disable expertise tracking while maintaining conversation memory
2. Use domain confidence as primary sophistication indicator
3. Revert to Story 1.2 question generation without adaptation

### Safety Checks

- [ ] Expertise tracking can be disabled without affecting question generation
- [ ] Progressive disclosure gracefully handles rapid domain switching
- [ ] Memory usage monitored with automatic cleanup on threshold breach
- [ ] Sophistication changes provide clear user feedback and manual override options
