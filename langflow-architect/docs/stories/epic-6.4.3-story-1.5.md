# Story 1.5: CopilotKit Action Enhancement and Performance Optimization

<!-- Source: Brownfield PRD + Architecture Document -->
<!-- Context: Complete system integration with action enhancement and performance optimization -->

## Status: Ready for Implementation

## Story

As a **user of the enhanced workflow system with questioning capabilities**,  
I want **questioning functionality integrated seamlessly with existing CopilotKit actions and optimized for production performance**,  
so that **I can access adaptive questioning through familiar action patterns while maintaining existing system responsiveness**.

## Context Source

- **Source Document**: Brownfield PRD (docs/brownfield-prd-epic-6.4.3.md) + Architecture Document (docs/brownfield-architecture.md)
- **Enhancement Type**: System-wide integration with action framework and performance optimization
- **Existing System Impact**: Enhanced CopilotKit actions with maintained performance characteristics
- **Dependencies**: Stories 1.1-1.4 (Foundation, Generation, Adaptation, UI) must be complete

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Objectives

1. **Action Consistency**: Questioning actions use same parameter structures and response formats as existing actions

2. **Performance Optimization**: Question generation leverages existing `multiSourceKnowledge` caching for optimal response times

3. **CopilotKit Integration**: New questioning actions integrate seamlessly with existing 11-action framework

4. **Graceful Degradation**: Questioning works with conversation context when MCP servers or web search unavailable

### Integration Verification Criteria

**IV1**: **Existing Action Preservation**

- All 11 existing CopilotKit actions maintain identical functionality and response times
- Existing action parameter structures and response formats unchanged
- Action discovery and invocation patterns continue working as before

**IV2**: **New Action Integration**

- Questioning-specific CopilotKit actions integrate seamlessly with existing action framework
- Action registration follows existing patterns for consistent behavior
- New actions appear alongside existing actions in CopilotKit interface

**IV3**: **Performance Target Verification**

- Total response time (domain detection + questioning) remains <3s under normal load conditions
- Question generation utilizes existing caching infrastructure for optimization
- System memory usage increase remains within acceptable bounds (<10% increase)

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

**Foundation from Stories 1.1-1.4**:

- Enhanced `DomainExpertiseProvider` with complete state management
- Question generation engine with adaptive sophistication
- Progressive disclosure system with expertise tracking
- Complete UI integration with existing domain detection interface

**CopilotKit Action Context** (from architecture):

- **11 Existing Actions**: Operational action framework with established patterns
- **Action Registration**: Existing action discovery and parameter handling
- **Response Formats**: Consistent response structure across all actions
- **Performance Requirements**: <3s response time for all action invocations

### Implementation Approach

**Enhanced CopilotKit Actions**:

```typescript
// New questioning-specific actions
interface QuestioningActions {
  generateAdaptiveQuestion: CopilotKitAction<{
    domainContext: DomainContext;
    expertiseLevel: ExpertiseLevel;
    conversationContext?: ConversationMemory;
  }>;
  
  processQuestionResponse: CopilotKitAction<{
    questionId: string;
    response: UserResponse;
    updateExpertise: boolean;
  }>;
  
  adjustQuestionSophistication: CopilotKitAction<{
    currentLevel: SophisticationLevel;
    direction: 'increase' | 'decrease';
    preserveContext: boolean;
  }>;
  
  getQuestioningProgress: CopilotKitAction<{
    domainContext: DomainContext;
    includeHistory: boolean;
  }>;
}

// Integration with existing action framework
interface EnhancedActionFramework {
  existingActions: ExistingCopilotKitActions[]; // Unchanged - 11 actions
  questioningActions: QuestioningActions;
  actionRegistration: ConsistentActionRegistration;
  responseHandling: UnifiedResponseHandling;
}
```

**Performance Optimization Architecture**:

```typescript
// Leverage existing infrastructure for optimal performance
interface PerformanceOptimizedQuestioning {
  caching: {
    multiSourceKnowledgeCache: ExistingCacheSystem; // Reuse existing
    questionGenerationCache: Map<DomainContext, AdaptiveQuestion[]>;
    expertiseProgressCache: Map<UserId, ExpertiseProfile>;
  };
  
  optimization: {
    lazyLoading: ComponentLazyLoading;
    memoryManagement: MemoryUsageOptimization;
    responseTimeMonitoring: PerformanceMetrics;
  };
  
  gracefulDegradation: {
    offlineQuestionGeneration: LocalQuestionFallbacks;
    contextualQuestionCache: ConversationBasedQuestions;
    reducedComplexityMode: SimplifiedQuestioningMode;
  };
}
```

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

**Primary Risk**: New questioning actions interfering with existing CopilotKit action framework  
**Mitigation**: Strict action isolation, comprehensive integration testing with existing actions  
**Verification**: Side-by-side testing of existing actions with and without questioning actions

**Performance Risk**: Questioning system adding latency or memory overhead affecting existing performance  
**Mitigation**: Aggressive caching, lazy loading, memory optimization, performance monitoring  
**Verification**: Load testing with questioning system active vs disabled

**Reliability Risk**: Questioning actions failing and affecting overall system stability  
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, automatic fallback systems  
**Verification**: Fault injection testing and recovery time measurement

### Rollback Plan

**Immediate Rollback**:

1. Disable questioning actions via feature flag - existing CopilotKit actions continue unchanged
2. Remove questioning action registration while maintaining all other functionality
3. Fallback to questioning system without CopilotKit action integration

**Partial Rollback**:

1. Disable specific questioning actions while maintaining core questioning functionality
2. Reduce questioning action complexity to minimal implementations
3. Enable questioning actions only for specific user groups or environments

### Safety Checks

- [ ] All 11 existing CopilotKit actions function identically with questioning actions present
- [ ] System response time remains <3s with all questioning actions enabled
- [ ] Memory usage increase remains within <10% acceptable bounds
- [ ] Questioning actions can be completely disabled without affecting existing functionality
