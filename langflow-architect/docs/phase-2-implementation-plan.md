# Phase 2 Implementation Plan - Langflow Architect

## ðŸŽ¯ Summary of Current State vs. Planned Features

### âœ… Phase 1 Achievements (Actually Completed)
Epic 6 Phase 1 has been successfully completed with the following components:

**Core MCP Infrastructure:**
- `mcpConfigService.ts` - MCP server configuration management
- `mcpValidationService.ts` - Connection validation and health checking
- `useMcpServers.ts` - React hooks for server management
- `McpToolCall.tsx` - Tool call rendering component
- `KnowledgeAttribution.tsx` - Attribution component for knowledge sources
- `mcp.ts` - Complete TypeScript interface definitions

**Integration Foundation:**
- `CopilotProvider.tsx` - Enhanced CopilotKit provider
- `route.ts` - API routing foundation (ready for Phase 2 enhancement)
- 11/11 Phase 1 tests passing
- 100% TypeScript strict compliance

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2 Plan (Implementation Required)

The following components were outlined in the development plan but need to be implemented:

#### 1. Documentation Grounding and Schema Compliance
**Target Components:**
- `DocsIngestionService` - GitHub API client with ETag caching for Langflow documentation
- `LangflowSchemaRegistry` - AJV-based JSON schema validation with normalized component models
- `DocsMcpServer` - Lightweight MCP server serving schemas, components, and samples with webhook support

**Implementation Priority:** High - Required for workflow validation

#### 2. Web Search Integration with Attribution
**Target Components:**
- `SearchManager` - Tavily + DuckDuckGo integration with intelligent fallback
- Domain filtering, deduplication, ranking, caching, and per-result attribution
- Performance optimization: target p50 < 1s response times

**Implementation Priority:** High - Required for enhanced prompting

#### 3. ContextEngine Upgrades for Grounded Prompting
**Target Components:**
- Enhanced Context Fusion: User chat + Langflow docs + web search results
- Guardrails: Official docs prioritized over web sources with version tagging
- Structured Context: Metadata-rich context objects for enhanced reasoning

**Implementation Priority:** Medium - Builds on search and docs components

#### 4. Enhanced CopilotKit Action
**Target Component:**
- `enhanced_workflow_analysis` action integrating all Phase 2 features:
  - Context intelligence with domain detection
  - Documentation grounding from official Langflow docs
  - Web search enhancement with attribution
  - Schema-aware component recommendations
  - Comprehensive fallback mechanisms

**Implementation Priority:** Low - Final integration of all Phase 2 features

### ðŸš¨ Current Blocking Issues

**Build Failures:**
- Missing import: `../../../lib/enhanced/contextEngine` in route.ts
- Missing import: `../../../lib/enhanced/mcpManager` in route.ts
- Integration tests failing due to missing enhanced modules
- Test status: Failing (not 14/16 passing as claimed)

**Required Before Phase 2:**
1. Create missing enhanced module structure
2. Implement basic contextEngine, mcpManager, searchManager modules
3. Fix route.ts imports to resolve build failures
4. Restore test passing status

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps Configuration

### API Keys Required for Phase 2
```bash
# Environment Variables to Configure
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key"
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"  # Already required
```

### Feature Flags to Enable
```typescript
// In feature-flags.ts or environment variables
export const FEATURE_SEARCH = true;
export const FEATURE_DOCS_GROUNDING = true;
export const ENABLE_MCP_COMPOSER = true;  // Already enabled
```

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```typescript
// Telemetry configuration for Phase 2
export const TELEMETRY_CONFIG = {
  enableCacheMetrics: true,
  enableResponseTimeTracking: true,
  enableErrorAnalytics: true,
  enableSearchPerformance: true
};
```

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Foundation Repair
- [ ] Create `src/lib/enhanced/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement basic `contextEngine.ts` module
- [ ] Implement basic `mcpManager.ts` module
- [ ] Implement basic `searchManager.ts` module (referenced in integration tests)
- [ ] Fix route.ts imports
- [ ] Restore test passing status

### Week 2-3: Documentation Integration
- [ ] Implement `DocsIngestionService` with GitHub API
- [ ] Create `LangflowSchemaRegistry` for schema validation
- [ ] Setup `DocsMcpServer` for documentation serving
- [ ] Add webhook support for real-time documentation updates

### Week 4-5: Search Integration
- [ ] Implement Tavily API integration
- [ ] Add DuckDuckGo search functionality
- [ ] Create caching and performance optimization
- [ ] Add domain filtering and result ranking

### Week 6-7: Context Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance ContextEngine with document grounding
- [ ] Implement source attribution and metadata
- [ ] Add guardrails for document prioritization
- [ ] Create structured context objects

### Week 8: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Implement `enhanced_workflow_analysis` action
- [ ] Integrate all Phase 2 features
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Achieve target performance metrics
- [ ] Comprehensive testing and validation

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

### Phase 2 Target Metrics
- **Documentation Grounding**: 100% of generated workflows validate against official Langflow schemas
- **Search Integration**: Real-time web search with full source attribution
- **Performance**: p50 < 1s response times for enhanced queries
- **Cache Efficiency**: >70% cache hit rate for knowledge queries
- **Test Coverage**: 14/16 integration tests passing (87.5% success rate)
- **Build Status**: Clean build with no failing imports

### Ready for Production Checklist
- [ ] All enhanced modules implemented and tested
- [ ] API keys configured in production environment
- [ ] Feature flags enabled for controlled rollout
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks operational
- [ ] Schema validation ensuring Langflow compatibility

## ðŸ“ž Support and Scaling

### Horizontal Scaling Components
- MCP server infrastructure designed for multi-instance deployment
- Search caching layer supports distributed caching
- Documentation ingestion supports rate limiting and load balancing
- Context engine stateless design enables horizontal scaling

### Monitoring and Optimization
- Built-in telemetry for cache hits, response times, and errors
- Performance metrics for search and documentation queries
- Error analytics with retry logic and timeout handling
- Health checks and capability-based routing for MCP servers

This implementation plan provides a realistic roadmap for completing Phase 2 development based on the actual current state of the codebase.
