# Sprint 01 Plan: Epic 6 - Advanced Socratic Engine (Part 1)

## Sprint Details

**Sprint Number:** 01
**Dates:** 2025-09-02 to 2025-09-15
**Status:** âš« **Not Started**

---

## Sprint Goal

The primary goal of this sprint is to **implement the core adaptive question generation engine**. By the end of this sprint, the application should be able to dynamically generate relevant, context-aware questions based on the user's detected domain, moving beyond the foundational work of Story 1.1.

This sprint directly addresses the highest priority item on our roadmap: **Epic 6: Brownfield Advanced Socratic**.

---

## Sprint Backlog

This sprint will focus exclusively on the user story **Epic 6.4.3, Story 1.2: Adaptive Question Generation Engine**.

### User Story

**As a** Langflow workflow designer,
**I want** dynamic question generation based on my detected domain and current conversation context,
**so that** I receive relevant questions that help me discover optimal patterns without hardcoded limitations.

### Key Tasks for Sprint 01

The following tasks are derived from the detailed story file `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.2.md`.

**Task 1: Core Question Generation Engine**
*   **Implement `questionGenerator.ts`:** Create the core logic for dynamic question generation using the existing OpenAI API connection.
*   **Build `contextualEnrichment.ts`:** Integrate with the `multiSourceKnowledge` system to enrich questions with domain-specific best practices.

**Task 2: Domain Integration and Context Awareness**
*   **Integrate with Domain Detection:** Use the `getActiveDomainContext()` to generate relevant questions without hardcoding.
*   **Implement Conversation Context:** Track conversation history to make new questions aware of the ongoing dialogue.

**Task 3: Question Engine Coordination**
*   **Build `questioningEngine.ts`:** Create the main engine to coordinate generation, enrichment, and validation.
*   **Implement `questionValidation.ts`:** Add checks to ensure question relevance and quality.

**Task 4: React Integration and Hooks**
*   **Create `useQuestionGeneration.ts` Hook:** Integrate the engine with the React frontend via the `DomainExpertiseProvider`.
*   **Build `useContextualQuestions.ts` Hook:** Provide an easy way for UI components to access and display the generated questions.

## Resource Allocation

| Role | Agent / Team Member | Primary Responsibilities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lead Developer** | BMad Lead Developer | Oversee implementation of all tasks. Focus on `questioningEngine.ts` and core architecture. |
| **Developer** | BMad Developer | Implement `questionGenerator.ts`, `contextualEnrichment.ts`, and the React hooks. |
| **Lead QA Engineer** | BMad Lead QA Engineer | Develop and execute the test plan for Story 1.2. Verify all acceptance criteria, especially performance and non-interference with existing systems. |
| **Architect** | BMad Architect | Provide guidance on integration points and ensure the implementation adheres to the "Zero Modification" constraint. |
| **Scrum Master** | BMad Scrum Master | Facilitate daily stand-ups, remove impediments, and ensure the team adheres to BMAD processes. |

## Definition of Done

This sprint will be considered "Done" when:
1.  All tasks for Story 1.2 are complete.
2.  All acceptance criteria for Story 1.2 are met, including performance (<500ms additional latency) and domain detection accuracy (>90% maintained).
3.  The feature is fully controllable via the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SOCRATIC_QUESTIONING` feature flag.
4.  All new code is peer-reviewed and merged into the `dev` branch.
5.  The QA Engineer has signed off on the successful completion of the test plan.

## Next Steps

Upon successful completion of this sprint, the team will be ready to proceed with **Story 1.3: Progressive Disclosure and Expertise Tracking**, which will build upon the adaptive question engine created here.
