# Sprint 01 Plan: Epic 6 - Advanced Socratic Engine (Part 1)

## Sprint Details

**Sprint Number:** 01
**Dates:** September 2-15, 2025
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Significant progress made but critical issues remain

---

## Sprint Goal

The primary goal of this sprint is to **implement the core adaptive question generation engine**. By the end of this sprint, the application should be able to dynamically generate relevant, context-aware questions based on the user's detected domain, moving beyond the foundational work of Story 1.1.

This sprint directly addresses the highest priority item on our roadmap: **Epic 6: Brownfield Advanced Socratic**.

---

## Sprint Backlog

This sprint will focus exclusively on the user story **Epic 6.4.3, Story 1.2: Adaptive Question Generation Engine**.

### User Story

**As a** Langflow workflow designer,
**I want** dynamic question generation based on my detected domain and current conversation context,
**so that** I receive relevant questions that help me discover optimal patterns without hardcoded limitations.

### Key Tasks for Sprint 01

The following tasks are derived from the detailed story file `docs/stories/epic-6.4.3-story-1.2.md`.

**Task 1: Core Question Generation Engine** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

* **Implement `questionGenerator.ts`:** Create the core logic for dynamic question generation using the existing OpenAI API connection. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
* **Build `contextualEnrichment.ts`:** Integrate with the `multiSourceKnowledge` system to enrich questions with domain-specific best practices. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Task 2: Domain Integration and Context Awareness** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

* **Integrate with Domain Detection:** Use the `getActiveDomainContext()` to generate relevant questions without hardcoding. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
* **Implement Conversation Context:** Track conversation history to make new questions aware of the ongoing dialogue. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Task 3: Question Engine Coordination** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

* **Build `questioningEngine.ts`:** Create the main engine to coordinate generation, enrichment, and validation. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
* **Implement `questionValidation.ts`:** Add checks to ensure question relevance and quality. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

**Task 4: React Integration and Hooks** ‚úÖ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

* **Create `useQuestionGeneration.ts` Hook:** Integrate the engine with the React frontend via the `DomainExpertiseProvider`. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
* **Build `useContextualQuestions.ts` Hook:** Provide an easy way for UI components to access and display the generated questions. ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

### ‚úÖ **Completed Achievements**

**Story 1.1 - Foundation Component Availability** ‚úÖ FULLY COMPLETE

* **PR:** #15 merged to dev branch
* **Status:** All dependencies created, TypeScript interfaces implemented, feature flags working
* **Test Results:** 11/11 tests passing
* **Architecture:** Composition pattern successfully preserves existing functionality

**Story 1.2 - Core Implementation** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (with issues)

* **Status:** Core functionality implemented and merged to dev
* **DynamicExpertiseTracker:** 5/5 tests passing in isolation
* **Integration Tests:** 16/16 tests passing for component integration
* **Domain Analysis:** Healthcare/finance mapping functional
* **Contextual Question Generation:** Working as designed

**MCP Server Settings Page Enhancement** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

* **Branch:** `feature/add-settings-page-20250902` merged to dev
* **Status:** Comprehensive MCP server management interface deployed
* **Features:** Server type categories, transport guidance, form validation, educational content
* **Impact:** Significantly improved MCP server UX and reduced configuration complexity

**Testing Infrastructure Improvements** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

* **Status:** Comprehensive testing scenarios documented
* **Coverage:** 10 detailed test scenarios covering diverse domains
* **Quality:** Manual testing feedback system established
* **Integration:** QA procedures and validation checklists organized

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues Identified**

**Test Failures Blocking Production** üî¥ CRITICAL
* **Total Tests:** 114 tests executed
* **Pass Rate:** 84.2% (96 passed, 18 failed)
* **Impact:** System functional but not production-ready
* **Primary Issues:**
  * ContextEngine domain analysis misclassification ("patient" vs "healthcare")
  * SearchManager error handling broken
  * Network service mocking failures in test environment
  * McpMarketplace component DOM manipulation errors

**Sprint Status Synchronization** üü° HIGH PRIORITY
* **Issue:** Sprint plan shows "Not Started" while significant work completed
* **Impact:** Misalignment between planning and actual progress
* **Resolution:** Updated sprint plan to reflect true current status

### üìä **Sprint Metrics**

**Planned vs Actual:**
* **Planned Tasks:** 4 main tasks for Story 1.2
* **Completed Tasks:** All 4 tasks implemented (core functionality working)
* **Additional Achievements:** Story 1.1 completion, MCP enhancements, testing improvements
* **Critical Issues:** 18 test failures requiring immediate resolution

**Quality Metrics:**
* **Test Coverage:** Core functionality tested, integration issues identified
* **Code Quality:** TypeScript compliance maintained, composition patterns working
* **Architecture:** Zero modification constraint preserved, feature flags functional
* **Performance:** Core functionality meets requirements, integration issues to resolve

## Definition of Done

This sprint will be considered "Done" when:

1. All tasks for Story 1.2 are complete.
2. All acceptance criteria for Story 1.2 are met, including performance (<500ms additional latency) and domain detection accuracy (>90% maintained).
3. The feature is fully controllable via the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SOCRATIC_QUESTIONING` feature flag.
