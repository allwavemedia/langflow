# Story Maintenance Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for maintaining story quality and currency throughout the Langflow Architect project lifecycle, ensuring stories remain accurate, relevant, and actionable as the project evolves.

## Maintenance Framework

### Maintenance Types

#### 1. Reactive Maintenance
- **Trigger**: Issues discovered during implementation or post-deployment
- **Scope**: Address specific problems or inconsistencies
- **Timeline**: Within 48 hours of issue identification
- **Responsibility**: Story author or assigned maintainer

#### 2. Proactive Maintenance
- **Trigger**: Scheduled review cycles or architecture changes
- **Scope**: Systematic review and updates for currency
- **Timeline**: Monthly for active epics, quarterly for completed epics
- **Responsibility**: Product Manager with technical review

#### 3. Architecture-Driven Maintenance
- **Trigger**: Significant architecture or technology changes
- **Scope**: Cascade updates across related stories
- **Timeline**: Within 1 week of architecture change approval
- **Responsibility**: Technical Architect with story author support

#### 4. Process Improvement Maintenance
- **Trigger**: Quality standard updates or process improvements
- **Scope**: Align stories with new standards and patterns
- **Timeline**: Within 2 weeks of standard updates
- **Responsibility**: Quality team with epic owners

## Maintenance Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

#### Code Integration Events
```yaml
maintenance_triggers:
  code_merge:
    - story_status_update
    - acceptance_criteria_validation
    - documentation_sync_check
  
  architecture_change:
    - impact_analysis
    - story_dependency_update
    - integration_pattern_validation
  
  dependency_update:
    - compatibility_check
    - story_requirement_update
    - testing_guidance_refresh
```

#### Quality Metrics Thresholds
- **Implementation Success Rate < 80%**: Story clarity review required
- **Review Cycle Time > 5 days**: Story completeness assessment
- **Developer Questions > 3 per story**: Technical detail enhancement
- **Post-deployment Issues > 2**: Acceptance criteria review

### Manual Triggers

#### Developer Feedback
- Implementation difficulty reports
- Missing technical details
- Outdated references or patterns
- Integration challenges

#### User Feedback
- Feature usability issues
- Unmet user expectations
- Missing functionality
- Performance concerns

#### Stakeholder Requests
- Business requirement changes
- Compliance requirement updates
- Strategic priority shifts
- Technology constraint changes

## Maintenance Procedures

### Procedure 3: Architecture Change Cascade

#### Change Impact Assessment
```typescript
// Example architecture change impact analysis
interface ArchitectureChange {
  change_id: string;
  description: string;
  affected_components: string[];
  breaking_changes: boolean;
  migration_required: boolean;
}

function assessStoryImpact(change: ArchitectureChange, stories: Story[]): StoryImpactReport {
  return {
    directly_affected: stories.filter(s => 
      s.components.some(c => change.affected_components.includes(c))
    ),
    indirectly_affected: stories.filter(s => 
      s.dependencies.some(d => change.affected_components.includes(d))
    ),
    migration_required: change.breaking_changes ? stories.filter(s => 
      s.integration_points.some(ip => change.affected_components.includes(ip))
    ) : [],
    update_priority: calculateUpdatePriority(change, stories)
  };
}
```

#### Cascade Update Process
1. **Identify Affected Stories**: Use automated analysis to identify stories requiring updates
2. **Prioritize Updates**: Critical stories first, then by epic dependency order
3. **Update Stories**: Apply necessary changes with technical review
4. **Validate Changes**: Ensure updates maintain story quality and completeness
5. **Coordinate Communication**: Notify development teams of changes
