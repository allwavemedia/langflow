# Story Maintenance Procedures

This document describes the procedures for maintaining user stories over time to ensure they remain accurate, relevant, and aligned with the project's evolving needs.

## Triggers for Maintenance

A user story may require maintenance under the following circumstances:

-   **Scope Changes**: The project's scope or requirements change, impacting the story.
-   **Technical Debt**: The story's implementation creates technical debt that needs to be addressed.
-   **New Insights**: New information or user feedback reveals that the story needs to be updated.
-   **Dependency Updates**: Changes in related stories or epics necessitate modifications.

## Maintenance Process

1.  **Identify the Need**: Any team member can identify the need for story maintenance and create an issue or task in the project management tool.

2.  **Assess the Impact**: The Product Manager and Technical Lead assess the impact of the required changes on the story and its dependencies.

3.  **Prioritize the Work**: The maintenance task is prioritized based on its urgency and impact on the project.

4.  **Update the Story**:
    *   The assigned author updates the story file, clearly documenting the changes and the rationale behind them.
    *   The updated story goes through the [Ongoing Story Review Process](./story-review-process.md) to ensure it meets quality standards.

5.  **Communicate the Changes**: The author communicates the changes to all relevant stakeholders, including the development team, QA, and other product managers.

## Versioning

While Git handles version history, significant changes to a story should be noted in a "Change Log" section within the story file itself to provide a clear and accessible history of modifications.

## Archiving Stories

-   **Completed Stories**: Once a story is implemented and verified, it is considered "Done" and remains in the repository as a historical record.
-   **Superseded Stories**: If a story is superseded by a new one, it should be marked as "SUPERSEDED" at the top of the file, with a reference to the story that replaces it. This preserves the historical context while preventing confusion.
