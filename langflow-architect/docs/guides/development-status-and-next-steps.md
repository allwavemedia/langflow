# Development Status and Next Steps

## Current Status (As of August 28, 2025)

This document provides a clear overview of the current development status for the Langflow Architect project, along with the recommended next steps to maintain development momentum and ensure alignment with our strategic goals.

### Active Development: Story 6.1 - MCP Server Marketplace

The current sprint is focused on the implementation of **Story 6.1: MCP Server Discovery and Marketplace**. This is a significant feature that provides a user-friendly interface for discovering, testing, and integrating MCP servers.

**Key developments from the ongoing Pull Request #7 include:**
-   A new **MCP Marketplace UI** (`McpMarketplace.tsx`) with advanced search, filtering, and sorting.
-   A **one-click preview system** (`McpConnectionTest.tsx`) that allows users to test MCP servers without permanent installation.
-   A dedicated **marketplace service** (`mcpMarketplaceService.ts`) to fetch data from the CopilotKit SSE endpoint.

### Architectural Evolution: Epic 2 is Superseded

It is critical for all team members to understand that **Epic 2: Enhanced Socratic Engine** has been **SUPERSEDED** by **Epic 5: Enhanced Agent Intelligence with Web Search & MCP Integration**.

The user stories in `epic-2-enhanced-socratic.md` are now outdated and should only be used for historical reference. Development should be based on the architecture and patterns established in Epic 5. This shift reflects our move towards a more robust, domain-aware, and context-driven agent architecture.

### Documentation Restructuring

The project's documentation has been significantly reorganized to improve clarity and accessibility. Key changes include:
-   A new `docs/plans/` directory now contains all major execution and implementation plans.
-   A new `docs/method/` directory houses the `bmad-methodology-reference.md`, which is the central guide for our development process.
-   The `implementation-roadmap.md` has been updated to reflect the current project status.

Please familiarize yourself with the new documentation structure.

## Next Steps for Development

With the foundational work for the MCP Marketplace nearing completion, the next phase of development should focus on resolving critical story issues and continuing to build out the core capabilities of the Langflow Architect.

### Priority 1: Complete Story 6.1

The immediate priority is to complete the implementation of Story 6.1. This will provide the necessary infrastructure for the upcoming work in Epic 6.4 and deliver immediate value to our users.

### Priority 2: Address Superseded Epics and Enhance Technical Details

Once Story 6.1 is complete, the focus should shift to the following, as outlined in the `systematic-story-validation-improvement-plan.md`:

1.  **Migrate Epic 2:** Ensure all relevant concepts from the superseded Epic 2 are properly migrated to or accounted for in Epic 5 and other active epics. This includes updating any remaining references to Epic 2 in our documentation and codebase.
2.  **Enhance Epic 6.4:** The stories in `epic-6-phase-4-domain-expertise.md` require more technical detail to be development-ready. The **Architect** should work with the **Developer** to add component specifications, environment configurations, and detailed testing scenarios.

### Recommended Workflow

To tackle these next steps, the team should use the following BMad workflow:

1.  **`*agent pm`**: The Product Manager should create and prioritize the tasks for the Epic 2 migration and Epic 6.4 enhancement.
2.  **`*agent architect`**: The Architect will be responsible for designing the technical implementation for the Epic 6.4 stories.
3.  **`*agent dev`**: The Developer will implement the required changes.

We will use the `*workflow brownfield-fullstack` to manage this enhancement process.

By following this plan, we can systematically improve the quality of our user stories, unblock future development, and continue to build a powerful and reliable Langflow Architect.
