# Development Status and Next Steps

## Current Status (As of August 28, 2025)

This document provides a clear overview of the current development status for the Langflow Architect project, along with the recommended next steps to maintain development momentum and ensure alignment with our strategic goals.

### Active Development: Story 6.1 - MCP Server Marketplace

The current sprint is focused on the implementation of **Story 6.1: MCP Server Discovery and Marketplace**. This is a significant feature that provides a user-friendly interface for discovering, testing, and integrating MCP servers.

**Key developments from the ongoing Pull Request #7 include:**
-   A new **MCP Marketplace UI** (`McpMarketplace.tsx`) with advanced search, filtering, and sorting.
-   A **one-click preview system** (`McpConnectionTest.tsx`) that allows users to test MCP servers without permanent installation.
-   A dedicated **marketplace service** (`mcpMarketplaceService.ts`) to fetch data from the CopilotKit SSE endpoint.

### Architectural Evolution: Epic 2 is Superseded

It is critical for all team members to understand that **Epic 2: Enhanced Socratic Engine** has been **SUPERSEDED** by **Epic 5: Enhanced Agent Intelligence with Web Search & MCP Integration**.

The user stories in `epic-2-enhanced-socratic.md` are now outdated and should only be used for historical reference. Development should be based on the architecture and patterns established in Epic 5. This shift reflects our move towards a more robust, domain-aware, and context-driven agent architecture.

### Documentation Restructuring

The project's documentation has been significantly reorganized to improve clarity and accessibility. Key changes include:
-   A new `docs/plans/` directory now contains all major execution and implementation plans.
-   A new `docs/method/` directory houses the `bmad-methodology-reference.md`, which is the central guide for our development process.
-   The `implementation-roadmap.md` has been updated to reflect the current project status.

Please familiarize yourself with the new documentation structure.

## Next Steps for Development

With the foundational work for the MCP Marketplace nearing completion, significant progress has been made on addressing critical story issues and preparing for the next phase of development.

### Priority 1: Complete Story 6.1

The immediate priority is to complete the implementation of Story 6.1. This will provide the necessary infrastructure for the upcoming work in Epic 6.4 and deliver immediate value to our users.

### Priority 2: Address Superseded Epics and Enhance Technical Details âœ… COMPLETED

**Epic 2 Migration - âœ… COMPLETED**
All relevant concepts from the superseded Epic 2 have been properly documented with migration guidance to Epic 5 and other active epics. The documentation now includes:
- Clear superseded notices with developer guidance to avoid confusion
- Detailed migration mapping for all 6 Epic 2 stories to their Epic 5 equivalents
- Specific references to the Epic Consolidation Guide for comprehensive migration details
- Updated status markers to prevent accidental implementation of superseded stories

**Epic 6.4 Enhancement - âœ… COMPLETED**
The stories in `epic-6-phase-4-domain-expertise.md` now include comprehensive technical details and are development-ready. Enhancements include:
- **Component Specifications**: Detailed file paths, dependencies, and integration patterns
- **Environment Configuration**: Specific configuration files, MCP server mappings, and AI settings
- **Testing Scenarios**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E test specifications
- **Performance Requirements**: Specific timing and resource usage targets
- **AI Integration Patterns**: GPT-4 function calling, context management, and prompt engineering details

### Current Development Status

**âœ… READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
- Epic 6.4 stories are now development-ready with complete technical specifications
- Epic 2 migration guidance eliminates confusion and provides clear implementation paths
- BMad workflow (`*workflow brownfield-fullstack`) is properly configured and available

### Recommended Workflow

The team can now proceed with Epic 6.4 implementation using the following BMad workflow:

1.  **`*agent pm`**: Product Manager to prioritize Epic 6.4 stories and create implementation tasks
2.  **`*agent architect`**: Architect to review technical specifications and finalize implementation approach
3.  **`*agent dev`**: Developer to implement the enhanced Epic 6.4 stories using the detailed specifications

Use `*workflow brownfield-fullstack` to manage this enhancement process systematically.

With the enhanced documentation and clear technical specifications, development teams can now proceed with confidence, knowing that all critical story validation issues have been resolved and Epic 6.4 is fully prepared for implementation.

**ðŸ“‹ Completion Summary**: For detailed validation of all completed work, see [Langflow Architect Development Progress - Completion Summary](../completion-summary-langflow-architect-development.md).

## BMad Workflow Integration

The Langflow Architect project is fully configured with the BMad development methodology. Teams can leverage the following workflow commands:

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# For Epic 6.4 implementation (recommended approach)
*workflow brownfield-fullstack

# For individual story work
*agent pm        # Product management and task prioritization
*agent architect # Technical design and architecture decisions  
*agent dev       # Implementation and development work
```

### Workflow Documentation
- **Full Workflow Guide**: See `.bmad-core/enhanced-ide-development-workflow.md` for step-by-step development process
- **Agent Configurations**: Located in `web-bundles/agents/` directory
- **Available Tasks**: See `.bmad-core/tasks/` for specific development tasks

### Integration with Enhanced Documentation
The enhanced Epic 6.4 specifications include BMad command references for each story, enabling seamless integration between planning and implementation phases.
