# Dynamic Domain Discovery Engine - Usage Guide

The Dynamic Domain Discovery Engine is a powerful addition to the Langflow Socratic Agent system that provides intelligent, context-aware domain detection and component recommendations without any hardcoded domain patterns.

## Overview

Unlike traditional systems that rely on predefined categories, the Dynamic Domain Discovery Engine:

- **Automatically detects** domain context from natural language input
- **Generates intelligent questions** tailored to the detected domain
- **Recommends relevant components** based on domain expertise
- **Adapts to user expertise level** (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- **Identifies compliance requirements** automatically
- **Supports seamless domain switching** within conversations

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from langflow.agent.socratic_engine import SocraticEngine
import asyncio

async def example():
    engine = SocraticEngine()
    
    # Generate a domain-aware question
    question = await engine.generate_dynamic_question(
        "I need to build a healthcare workflow for patient data with HIPAA compliance",
        session_id="user_123"
    )
    print(f"Question: {question}")
    
    # Get domain insights
    insights = await engine.get_domain_insights("user_123")
    print(f"Domain: {insights['domain']}")
    print(f"Compliance: {insights['compliance_frameworks']}")

asyncio.run(example())
```

### Domain Detection

The engine automatically detects domains from user input:

```python
from langflow.agent.domain_discovery import domain_discovery_engine

# Healthcare example
result = await domain_discovery_engine.analyze_user_context(
    "I need to process patient medical records with HIPAA compliance"
)
# Result: domain="healthcare", confidence=0.9, indicators=["patient", "medical", "hipaa"]

# Finance example  
result = await domain_discovery_engine.analyze_user_context(
    "Build a trading system with SOX compliance for financial transactions"
)
# Result: domain="finance", confidence=0.9, indicators=["trading", "sox", "financial"]
```

## Supported Domains

The engine dynamically detects these domains (and can learn new ones):

### Healthcare
- **Keywords**: patient, medical, clinical, healthcare, HIPAA, PHI, EHR
- **Components**: HIPAA Validator, PHI Data Handler, Audit Trail Logger
- **Compliance**: HIPAA, HITECH, FDA

### Finance
- **Keywords**: trading, financial, banking, payment, SOX, PCI
- **Components**: Financial Data Encryptor, Transaction Validator
- **Compliance**: SOX, PCI-DSS, GDPR

### Technology/API
- **Keywords**: API, REST, database, microservice, OAuth, authentication
- **Components**: HTTP Request, JSON Processor, OAuth Authenticator
- **Patterns**: Integration, service-oriented architecture

### Manufacturing
- **Keywords**: supply chain, inventory, production, logistics
- **Components**: Inventory Manager, Production Tracker
- **Patterns**: Supply chain optimization

### Education
- **Keywords**: learning, student, course, curriculum, assessment
- **Components**: Learning Tracker, Assessment Engine
- **Patterns**: Educational workflows

## Advanced Features

### Domain Switching

Users can switch domains within the same conversation:

```python
# Start with healthcare
await engine.generate_dynamic_question("I need healthcare workflow", "session1")

# Switch to finance
result = await engine.switch_domain_context("Now I need trading system", "session1")
print(f"Switched from {result['previous_domain']} to {result['new_domain']}")
```

### Component Recommendations

Get intelligent component recommendations based on domain:

```python
activation_result = await domain_discovery_engine.activate_domain_expertise(
    "I need HIPAA-compliant patient data processing", "session1"
)

for rec in activation_result.recommendations:
    print(f"{rec.name}: {rec.description} (Score: {rec.relevance_score})")
```

### Expertise Level Detection

The engine automatically detects user expertise and adapts accordingly:

- **Beginner**: Simple, high-level questions
- **Intermediate**: Technical but accessible questions  
- **Advanced**: Complex architectural questions

```python
# Beginner indicators: "simple", "basic", "workflow"
# Intermediate indicators: "API", "database", "integration"
# Advanced indicators: "microservice", "kubernetes", "distributed"
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backward Compatibility

The enhanced Socratic Engine maintains full backward compatibility:

```python
# Traditional usage still works
engine = SocraticEngine()
question = engine.generate_initial_question("chatbot")  # Still works
parsed = engine.parse_user_response("user input")       # Still works
```

### State Management

Domain contexts are automatically managed:

```python
# Context is cached per session
context = engine.get_active_domain_context("session_id")

# Reset when needed
engine.reset()  # Clears question history, preserves domain cache
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite available:

```bash
# Run domain discovery tests
python -m pytest src/backend/tests/unit/test_domain_discovery.py -v

# Run enhanced Socratic Agent tests  
python -m pytest src/backend/tests/unit/test_socratic_agent.py::TestSocraticEngine -v
```

## Example Outputs

### Healthcare Domain
```
Input: "I need to process patient medical records with HIPAA compliance"
Question: "What type of healthcare data will your workflow process?"
Domain: healthcare (0.90 confidence)
Components: HIPAA Validator, PHI Data Handler, Audit Trail Logger
Compliance: HIPAA
```

### Finance Domain
```
Input: "Build a trading system with real-time financial data"
Question: "What type of financial data will be processed?"
Domain: finance (0.90 confidence)  
Components: Financial Data Encryptor, Transaction Validator
Compliance: SOX, PCI-DSS
```

### Technology Domain
```
Input: "Create REST API with OAuth and database connections"
Question: "What APIs or services do you need to integrate with?"
Domain: technology (0.90 confidence)
